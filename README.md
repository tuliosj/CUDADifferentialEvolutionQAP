# CUDADifferentialEvolutionQAP

This repo has three different approaches on solving the QAP using the Differential Evolution Algorithm on CUDA, as described on my text.
It's a fork from ianran, but pretty much none of the original code remains. The repo is still open for improvements based on future works.

### How to use:

There are three different implementations, to test each one out, you have to `make cpu`, `make gpu` or `make cpu-p`. Then just run the output.
